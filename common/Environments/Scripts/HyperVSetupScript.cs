                This script does the following:
                1. Checks if the user is in the Hyper-V Administrators group and adds them if they are not in it
                2. Checks if the Hyper-V Feature is enabled and enables the feature if it is not already enabled.
                3. If the user is in the Hyper-V Administrators group and the Hyper-V feature is enabled. The script does nothing.

                The script uses the following exit codes to signal to Dev Home what message it should show to the user.

                Exit Codes (Note: we don't use exit code of 1 since that's the generic exit code if there was an exception):
                0. The script successfully added the user to the Hyper-V Admin Group and enabled the Hyper-V Feature.
                2. The user is not in the Hyper-V Admin Group and the Hyper-V Feature is already enabled. The script successfully added the user to the Hyper-V Admin group.
                3. The user is not in the Hyper-V Admin Group and the Hyper-V Feature is already enabled. The script failed to add the user to the Hyper-V Admin group.
                4. The user is in the Hyper-V Admin group and the Hyper-V Feature is not already enabled. The script successfully enabled the Hyper-Feature.
                5. The user is in the Hyper-V Admin group and the Hyper-V Feature is not already enabled. The script failed to enable the Hyper-Feature.
                6. The user is already in the Hyper-V Admin group and the Hyper-V Feature is already enabled.
