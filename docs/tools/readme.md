# Tools

Dev Home adds functionality through a set of tools. Each tool provides a page in the Dev Home navigation view. Currently, all tools come from in-package assemblies. Third party or out-of-process tools are not supported at this time.

Learn more about [creating a tool](./creating-a-tool.md). Then, learn about [advanced tool behavior](./advanced-tool-behavior.md).

Tools utilize data and functionality from out-of-process [extensions](../extensions/extensions.md). This is done through the Extension SDK API. 

Tools support [experimental features](./ExperimentalFeatures.md).
