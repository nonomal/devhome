/// This interface is to be extended for each kind of elevated operation we need to perform.
/// Each method will execute an operation recognized by the elevated process from its input arguments.
///
/// The types here need to be projected using CsWinRT, so there are restrictions on them.
/// * The types must be `public sealed class` or `public interface`.
/// * All public members must use only types that can be projected with CsWinRT.
/// If the projection fails, it will only produce a warning, but the build is likely to
/// fail further down the line when attempting to use the types that should have been created.
